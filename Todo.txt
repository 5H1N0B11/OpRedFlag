Done, needs testing
===================
Make AI version of Viggen for Raider1.
Defeat spam filter with hit/fire messages.
Accuracy of M2000 missiles.
Improve drastic the quality of acceleration to degree function in proportional navigation.
Make cannon work on F-15

Fairly small tasks
==================
Implement damage formula Raider1 found to damage code.
Look at Mirage's use of me.free to make sure it can hit after it goes free.

Bigger tasks
============
Merge missile code with Shinobi's, so we only have 1 missile code to maintain.
Make missiles bleed energy when doing high G turns.
Framerate drop of F-15 missiles?
