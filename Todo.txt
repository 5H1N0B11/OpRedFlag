Done, needs testing
===================
F15: Selecting new target and firing just after, would sometimes make it fire at wrong target, due to delays in search/lock code.
Fix G drop in missiles. (Simple solution still eludes me)
Lofting beyond boost stage.
Port rail/drop code from Viggen to F15/14.
Use Richards ORF branch.
Make missile hits more deadly.
Check f15 cannon hits work. (works)
Cheat msg if open up failure dialog.
No failure msgs, but sound.
Use units instead of gear in F15 anti-cheat code.
Add sea eagle and GBU16. Andd add grav bomb code to mirage.

Fairly small tasks
==================
Implement damage formula Raider1 found to damage code.
Port anti-cheat code from Viggen/F15 to F14 and Mirage.
AIM-120 on rails will be rail launched, else dropped.
New drag on other planes.
Cruise-missiles on F15/14.
Damage report distance in console is off.
Add seaeagle to damage.
Remake 3.4 versions of F15/14.

Bigger tasks
============
Merge missile code with Shinobi's, so we only have 1 missile code to maintain.
Make missiles bleed energy when doing high G turns.



How-to keep updated with Richards ORF branch:
---------------------------------------------
+1 - Fetch his branch
+2 - Copy those files into my ORF repo one by one, and check diff
3 - Modify those files in the aircraft/f-15
+4 - Commit the unmodified files to my ORF repo
+5 - Copy the modified files into my ORF repo and commit them.
+6 - Make further changes (Loft, Cruise, G-Drop, Rail & drop) both planes!
+7 - Commit those files.
+8 - Copy and commit the same files to local ORF branch.
9 - Make pull request if needed.
10 - Simplify the above points :)


===================
Merge missile code:
===================

Goal: Same missile code for all 4 aircraft: JA37, F15, F14 and M2000

Already done:
-------------
Restructure methods to seperate flying from searching/lock updates.
Missile streak visible over MP (prototype)
Rail or drop (7ft) simulation (solve if should be released into wind or not)
Cruise/cruising missiles (merge with my lofting/crusing)
Getting target properties from radar/property tree
Move armament stats to generic place in property tree
For future addition to new aircrafts, make sure to retain code to put diamond on default FG HUD.

Shinobi stuff that should be added:
-------
Max speed (convert to max speed above launch platform for some missiles)
Heat seeking (merge with my simulation of that)

Problems to solve:
------------------
How to port my check of target uniqueness and painted.
Time keeping system?

Future:
-------
Chaff sim
Better flare sim
Missile/lock warning on TWR
No MP chat msg.
