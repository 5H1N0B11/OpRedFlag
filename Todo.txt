Done, needs testing
===================
F15: Selecting new target and firing just after, would sometimes make it fire at wrong target, due to delays in search/lock code.

Fairly small tasks
==================
Implement damage formula Raider1 found to damage code.
Notching should only be possible below certain speeds.
Port anti-cheat code from Viggen.

Fix G drop in missiles. (Simple solution still eludes me)
Lofting beyond boost stage.
Port rail/drop code from Viggen to F15/14.
Use Richards ORF branch.

AIM-120 on rails will be rail launched, else dropped.

Bigger tasks
============
Merge missile code with Shinobi's, so we only have 1 missile code to maintain.
Make missiles bleed energy when doing high G turns.



How-to keep updated with Richards ORF branch:
---------------------------------------------
1 - Fetch his branch
2 - Copy those files into my ORF repo one by one, and check diff
3 - Modify those files in the aircraft/f-15
4 - Commit the unmodified files to my ORF repo
5 - Copy the modified files into my ORF repo and commit them.
6 - Make further changes (Loft, Cruise, G-Drop, Rail & drop)
7 - Commit those files.
8 - Copy and commit the same files to local ORF branch.
9 - Make pull request if needed.


===================
Merge missile code:
===================

Goal: Same missile code for all 4 aircraft: JA37, F15, F14 and M2000

Already done:
-------------
Restructure methods to seperate flying from searching/lock updates.
Missile streak visible over MP (prototype)
Rail or drop (7ft) simulation (solve if should be released into wind or not)

Shinobi stuff that should be added:
-------
Cruise/cruising missiles (merge with my lofting/crusing)
Max speed (convert to max speed above launch platform for some missiles)
Heat seeking (merge with my simulation of that)

Problems to solve:
------------------
How to port my check of target uniqueness and painted.
Getting target properties from radar/property tree
Move armament stats to generic place in property tree
For future addition to new aircrafts, make sure to retain code to put diamond on default FG HUD.

Future:
-------
Chaff sim
Better flare sim
Missile/lock warning on TWR
No MP chat msg.
