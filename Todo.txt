Done, needs testing
===================


Fairly small tasks
==================
Implement damage formula Raider1 found to damage code.
Notching should only be possible below certain speeds.
Port anti-cheat code from Viggen.
Port rail/drop code from Viggen.


Bigger tasks
============
Merge missile code with Shinobi's, so we only have 1 missile code to maintain.
Make missiles bleed energy when doing high G turns.



Merge missile code:
===================

Goal: Same missile code for all 4 aircraft: JA37, F15, F14 and M2000

Already done:
-------------
Restructure methods to seperate flying from searching/lock updates.
Missile streak visible over MP (prototype)
Rail or drop (7ft) simulation (solve if should be released into wind or not)

Shinobi stuff that should be added:
-------
Cruise missiles (merge with my lofting/crusing)
Max speed (convert to max speed above launch platform for some missiles)
Heat seeking (merge with my simulation of that)

Problems to solve:
------------------
Getting target properties from radar/property tree
Move armament stats to generic place in property tree
For future addition to new aircrafts, make sure to retain code to put diamond on default FG HUD.

Future:
-------
Chaff sim
Better flare sim
Missile/lock warning on TWR
No MP chat msg.
